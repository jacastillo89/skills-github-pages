Introduction to GitHub: A Quick Guide ðŸŒ±
- [x] GitHub: A collaboration platform using Git for versioning. It's the heart of open-source software development. 
- [x] Repository (Repo): Your project's home. It contains files/folders and tracks their versions. 
- [x] Branch: A parallel version of your repo. The default is 'main', but you can create more branches for testing and features, all without affecting the main. 
- [x] Profile README: Your personal introduction on GitHub. It's like an "About me" section displayed at the top of your profile.

Happy coding and explore with confidence! ðŸš€
